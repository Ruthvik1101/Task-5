Conclusion, I have  analyzed titanic datasets  using descriptive statistics like  (.describe(), .info(), and .value_counts()) and multiple visualizations like (pairplots, heatmaps, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and countplots) to reveal underlying patterns in the data. I have analyzed the survival was strongly influenced by passenger like (class, fare, age, and gender). Specifically, higher-class passengers, those who paid higher fares have high survival rates compared to third class who paid low fares and while the second class passengers have medium survival chance.
